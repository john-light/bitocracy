# Sovryn Team Handbook

## Welcome to Sovryn!

Sovryn's purpose is to create an open, fair, and transparent financial system for the world. This is a big challenge and we're excited for you to help!

We put this handbook together to make it as easy as possible for new team members such as yourself to find your way around, spending less time figuring out how things work and more time on the things that really matter.
